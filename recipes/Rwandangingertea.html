        <h3>WHEN YOU VISIT RWANDA YOU ARE SURE TO TASTE GINGER TEA</h3>
        <p>It is a warm creamy tea with milk, very similar to Indian Chai. <br> However, instead of a masala, or spice mix, of a combination of cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom, Rwandan black tea is blended solely with ginger. <br> The fresh ginger
            adds something so lively and sweet to the chai.
            <p>And the combination of locally grown black tea with sugar, milk, and ginger is addictive. The result is a smooth and luxurious Rwandan Ginger Tea.
                <br> Rwandan Ginger Tea was created when local people added local botanicals to the black tea that was being grown in Rwanda since the 1950s.</p>
