            <h4>Steps to make Rwandan goat brochettes</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak the wooden skewers in water for about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Form the brochettes by alternately threading meat and 2 to 3 pieces of onion onto the skewer.</li>
                <li>Mix the crushed tomatoes, the diced onions and the pili-pili chilies (pounded to a paste) along with the tomato puree. This should create a medium thick sauce; add a little oil and water to attain the desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Reserve half of the sauce for dipping.</li>
                <li>Put half the sauce in a pan with the skewers and turn to coat, let marinade for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Then lay the skewer on the grill Brush the sauce on all sides of the brochettes, adding more of the sauce as you turn them. Turn them about 3 times. Allow it to cook for about 3 minutes. The brochettes are ready when just cooked through
                    (about 8-10 minutes) and should be a nice reddish color, due to the sauce.</li>
                <li>Serve with sweet potato fries and use the reserved sauce for dipping.</li>
            </ol>
